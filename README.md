# Summary:
The assignment task discussed here can be summarized as art appropriation using digital techniques to create an immersive experience.

Note the functions in p5_project aren't relevant to the imaging techniques discuessed here.

## Part 1: Imaging Techniques


## Part 2:
The link provided in this section describes particle system animation, driven by Perlin noise to create natural, fluid motion.

This code is well-suited for animating *The Scream*'s iconic sky, and using Perlin noise to guide particle motion will create dynamic, swirling effects. It is therefore useful because:

- **Perlin Noise**: Produces organic, smooth motion, ideal for emulating the sky’s chaotic energy.
- **Color Transitions**: `lerpColor` allows for seamless color blending, customizable to match the painting’s palette.
- **Particle Movement**: Particles flow in swirling paths, mimicking the tension and movement in the sky.
- **Continuous Animation**: Particles reset off-screen, creating endless motion, reflecting the emotional intensity of the painting.
